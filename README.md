# Web Push Notifications

## By: Charles Jeffries, Sakan Pengdis, and Joshua Zimmerling

For our project, we have included all of the elements in our demo into the tutorial website so that the readers can see what their final product will look like as they follow along. Therefore both our tutorial and demo are combined into one folder, tutorial-demo.  

Since most web push notifications require an https connection, the local index.html file will not be able to fully demonstrate all of our functionality, so we have hosted the exact same code at: https://asupengdis.github.io/421Project/ so that every step of our demo can be seen on the web page.
