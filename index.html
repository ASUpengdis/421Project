                <p>
                    Modern browsers have begun including the Notifications API to allow developers an easy way to create basic
                    web push notifications. In this section, we will walk through the steps on how to create and handle a
                    notification.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <div class="step">Step 1: Set-up</div>
                    To set-up for our tutorial, we are going to start with 2 seperate files:
                    <ul>
                        <li>index.html</li>
                        <li>notifications.js</li>
                    </ul>
                    Inside of index.html, we are going to put this starter code that just lays out some buttons:
                    <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script src="notifications.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id="headerText"&gt; Let's Make a Notification! &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;input id="permissionButton" type="button" value="Click for permission"&gt;
        &lt;input id="notificationButton" type="button" value="Click for a push notification"&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
                    Opening this file in our browser we get a webpage that looks like this:<br />
                    <img style="border:solid" src="./tutorial/_sample_index_init-screenshot.png" /> <br /><br />
                    Inside of notifications.js, we want to grab a reference to these elements so that we can use them later
                    <pre>
let header = document.getElementById("headerText");
let permButton = document.getElementById("permissionButton");
let notifButton = document.getElementById("notificationButton");</pre>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <div class="step">Step 2: Asking for permission</div>
                    Before sending any notification, you need to ask the user if they will allow your page to send push
                    notifications. This is done using the requestPermission() function in a promise to wait for the response.
                    We will add this promise in a listener for our permissionButton, and store the result in a variable called status.
                    <pre>
let status;

permButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    let promise = Notification.requestPermission().then((result) => {
        $status = result;
    });
});</pre>
                    Now, once we click on the button, a pop-up will appear asking for permission to send notifications. 
                    Depending on the user's response, the possible values stored into status can be 'granted', 'denied', 
                    or 'default'.<br />
                    <img style="border:solid" src="./tutorial/_sample_index_perm-screenshot.png" /> <br />
                    <input id="btn" type="button" value="Click here for permission pop-up">
                    Here is an example of what that would look like.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <div class="step">Step 3: Creating our notification</div>
                    Once we have asked the user for permission to send them notifications, we need to know how to be able
                    to send them some. Our first step will be to create a Notification object that has two parameters, the Name
                    and the Properties. We will start off leaving the properites field empty, but we will come back and address
                    it later. Here is the code to create a notification:
                    <pre>
const notif = new Notification('Our new notification', {});</pre>
                    This creates a new notification, but we currently have no way of triggering this notification to appear. Let's
                    add a listener to this code to connect it to our button.
                    <pre>
notifButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const notif = new Notification('Our new notification', {});
});</pre>
                    Unfortunately, notifications are not able to show from just a local file and requires a hosted website that
                    uses HTTPS to ensure the notification is sent securely. Because of this, our index.html file will not be able
                    to display a notification unless you are able to host it somewhere like github pages. However to see what it
                    would look like, press the button below.<br />
                    <input id="btn2" type="button" value="Click here for a notification"><br /><br />
                    Depending on whether or not you gave us permission to send notifications, you may or may not have actually seen
                    a notification there. But how did we do that? Before pushing the notification, you should include a check on the
                    status that we got from asking permission in Step 2. Here is how we did it:
                    <pre>
notifButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if ($status === "granted") {
        const notif = new Notification('Our new notification', {});
    }
});</pre>
                </p>
                <input id="btn3" type="button" value="Click here3">
                <a href="./Testcodestuff/test.html">press</a>
                <a href="test2.html">asasdfasdf</a>
                <h3>Handling User Input</h3>
                <h3>Cloud Notifications</h3>
            </a>
            <a id="standards">
                <h2>Standards</h2>
                <p>
                    The main standard for push notifications is requesting permission from the user to allow your website to send 
                    notifications. MDN outlines that "Before an app can send a notification, the user must grant the application the 
                    right to do so" [1]. Furthermore, they discuss how push notifications had been abused in the past and that one
                    of the new countermeasures against that is to only request permission after the user gestures in some way that 
                    they may want these notifications, for example, clicking a button that says 'Keep Me Notified'. Once permission 
                    has been asked for, every notification should check to ensure that the current permission status is 'granted'.
                </p>
            </a>
            <a id="history">
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Web push notifications are a relatively new innovation to the web development scene, making their history
                    not span a very long way back in time. The first predecessor to notifications through the web is email communication
                    in which websites and companies can send mass emails to all of their users giving an update on whatever it is they
                    desire. In their article What are Push Notificiations - The Ultimate Guide, Gravitec states that "In 2001, RIM created
                    the first email alert system" [2]. This was the first appearance of any type of push notification system, and started
                    out as a functionality for the email app that was only on blackberry phones. Todd Grennan highlights that web push
                    stems off of the idea of mobile push, which originated back in 2009 with the rise of smart phones, however historically
                    web notifications have had a much harder time of being widely used and accepted. This reluctance of integration mainly
                    comes from users not trusting web notifications as much as mobile push notifications, causing a large percent of
                    people to decline websites the permissions necessary [3]. The first addition of web push notifications to browsers 
                    came in 2014 as Google added this functionality into Google Chrome. Slowly, thoroughout the next 4 years or so browsers
                    such as Opera, Firefox, Safari, and Edge begin to support this functionality [4].

                    As technology becomes more and more integrated into everyones daily life, more and more users will begin getting 
                    comfortable with this concept and help web push to grow into a mainstream feature on many websites.
