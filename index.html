                <p>
                    The main standard for push notifications is requesting permission from the user to allow your website to send 
                    notifications. MDN outlines that "Before an app can send a notification, the user must grant the application the 
                    right to do so" [1]. Furthermore, they discuss how push notifications had been abused in the past and that one
                    of the new countermeasures against that is to only request permission after the user gestures in some way that 
                    they may want these notifications, for example, clicking a button that says 'Keep Me Notified'. Once permission 
                    has been asked for, every notification should check to ensure that the current permission status is 'granted'.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Web push notifications are a relatively new innovation to the web development scene, making their history
                    not span a very long way back in time. The first predecessor to notifications through the web is email communication
                    in which websites and companies can send mass emails to all of their users giving an update on whatever it is they
                    desire. In their article What are Push Notificiations - The Ultimate Guide, Gravitec states that "In 2001, RIM created
                    the first email alert system" [2]. This was the first appearance of any type of push notification system, and started
                    out as a functionality for the email app that was only on blackberry phones. Todd Grennan highlights that web push
                    stems off of the idea of mobile push, which originated back in 2009 with the rise of smart phones, however historically
                    web notifications have had a much harder time of being widely used and accepted. This reluctance of integration mainly
                    comes from users not trusting web notifications as much as mobile push notifications, causing a large percent of
                    people to decline websites the permissions necessary [3]. The first addition of web push notifications to browsers 
                    came in 2014 as Google added this functionality into Google Chrome. Slowly, thoroughout the next 4 years or so browsers
                    such as Opera, Firefox, Safari, and Edge begin to support this functionality [4].

                <p>
                    As technology becomes more and more integrated into everyones daily life, more and more users will begin getting 
                    comfortable with this concept and help web push to grow into a mainstream feature on many websites.
